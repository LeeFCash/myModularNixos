updated my config "services.logind.settings" for no action for time and added to it and updated dolphen all do to a change done in what I was wanting to upgrade to(if I did not upgrade than I don't need to care and my system would still be good) - log 1
I made a dir for each pc and made it simple to backup the config (like undo or something) and changed display manager - log 2
