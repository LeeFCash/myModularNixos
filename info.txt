G = Gigabytes (GB) in the decimal system.

1 GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes.
Quick Clarification of Units:
K = Kilobytes (1 KB = 1,000 bytes)

M = Megabytes (1 MB = 1,000 KB = 1,000,000 bytes)

G = Gigabytes (1 GB = 1,000 MB = 1,000,000,000 bytes)

T = Terabytes (1 TB = 1,000 GB = 1,000,000,000,000 bytes)

Why the Keyboard Dongle Might Cause Lag While the Headset Dongle Works - Here are the key reasons why the Logitech K360’s Unifying Receiver (046d:c52b, USB 2.0, Bus 003) might cause lag while the Razer Nari Essential’s dongle (1532:051e, USB 2.0, Bus 005) does not: 1. 2.4GHz Interference: 1)Keyboard (Logitech K360): The Unifying Receiver uses a 2.4GHz wireless connection, which is susceptible to interference from other 2.4GHz devices, such as Wi-Fi (phy0 from rfkill list), Bluetooth (hci0, Intel Wireless-AC 3168 on Bus 001), or other nearby wireless devices (e.g., the Jelly Comb K071 if using 2.4GHz mode). Interference can cause packet loss or delays, leading to input lag.(2)Headset (Razer Nari Essential): The Nari Essential’s dongle also uses 2.4GHz, but it may employ better interference mitigation (e.g., frequency hopping or a stronger signal). Additionally, headsets typically have lower data rates for audio compared to keyboards, which require low-latency, high-frequency input events, making the keyboard more sensitive to interference.(3)Evidence: rfkill list shows active Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and lsusb places the Bluetooth controller on Bus 001, close to other devices, increasing interference risk.
